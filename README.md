# Course Bundle System Spring Boot App

## Problem Domain
KK, a platform providing educational resources, wants to create a course bundle
recommendation system that returns bundle quotes based on teacher requests.

## Scenario
Teachers can request different levels of content coverage for various course topics. For
example, a teacher may want 20 resources on reading, 50 on math, and 30 on science. This
request specifies the level of content needed for each topic to create a customized bundle
for their classroom.
Based on the teacherâ€™s request, quotes are provided by a set of resource providers. Each
provider can offer different rates for bundles depending on the topics they cover.

## Technologies
 - Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven
- JUnit 5
- MockMvc
- Spock Framework (optional)
- Jackson (JSON handling)
- SLF4J + Logback (logging)
- OpenAPI/Swagger (API docs)
